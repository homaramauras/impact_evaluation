# 📊 Impact Evaluation & Experimental Design

This repository contains selected applied econometrics and program evaluation problem sets completed in **Stata** and **R** as part of my graduate coursework and research training. The files demonstrate simulation-based inference, hypothesis testing, matching methods, and randomized experimental design with a focus on international development applications.

## 🧪 Experimental & Impact Evaluation (Stata)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ie_final.do` | Final exam simulation exploring IV estimation, hypothesis testing, and power under varying DGPs |
| `IE_PS1.do` | Simulates the emergence of the t-distribution across sample sizes and DGPs (normal, uniform, custom) |
| `IE_PS2.do` | Simulates education and labor market outcomes; investigates regression bias and selection effects |
| `exp_design_stata_4.do` | Simulates IV-based rejection regions and analyzes power under null and alternative hypotheses |

## 🔁 Matching & Causal Inference (R)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `2.3.cem.poverty.R` | Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to estimate treatment effects on poverty |
| `3.3.cem.rent.R` | CEM estimation of impacts on rental housing quality |
| `4.3.cem.empower.R` | CEM approach to estimate effects on women's empowerment outcomes |
| `5.2.combined_estimates.R` | Combines ATT estimates from multiple matching methods (CEM, PSM, MDM, GenMatch) for comparative analysis |

## 📌 Highlights

- Designed all simulations using `program define` in Stata and `tidyverse` pipelines in R.
- Topics covered include: treatment effect heterogeneity, causal inference, power simulations, IV vs. OLS comparisons, and covariate balancing.
- Matching estimators rely on `cem` and custom post-matching ATT extraction for evaluation reports.
