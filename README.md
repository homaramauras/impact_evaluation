# Impact Evaluation Code Samples â€“ Homar A. MaurÃ¡s RodrÃ­guez

This repository contains selected code samples from coursework and applied research related to impact evaluation, causal inference, and program evaluation in LMICs.

## Structure

### ðŸ”¹ Stata â€“ Impact Evaluation & Experimental Design
- `ie_final.do`: Final project from graduate-level Impact Evaluation course using DiD and matching techniques.
- `exp_design_stata_4.do`: Simulation-based assessment of RCT design and assignment bias.

### ðŸ”¹ R â€“ Matching & Treatment Effect Estimation
- `2.3.cem.poverty.R`: Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to estimate ATT on poverty outcomes.
- `5.2.combined_estimates.R`: Unified ATT estimation across CEM, PSM, MDM, GenMatch, and OLS.

### ðŸ”¹ R â€“ Covariate Selection with Lasso
- `2.2.1.cvlasso_covariates_poverty.R`: Lasso-based covariate selection for causal estimation.
- `1.6.balance_table_pre_matching.R`: Balance diagnostics and visualization using `cobalt`.

All code reflects experience using R and Stata for rigorous program evaluation and survey-based causal inference in LMIC settings.
